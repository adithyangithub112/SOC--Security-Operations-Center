# MONITORING

1. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
    
    A centralized platform that collects, normalizes, correlates, and analyzes logs from multiple sources to detect security threats.
    
2. Log Management
    
    The process of collecting, storing, and maintaining logs from systems, applications, and network devices for monitoring and investigation.
    
3. Log Source
    
    Any device or system that generates logs, such as firewalls, servers, endpoints, IDS/IPS, cloud platforms, and applications.
    
4. SOC (Security Operations Center)
    
    A centralized team responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents.
    
5. Dashboard
    
    A visual interface in monitoring tools that displays real-time alerts, security metrics, and system status.

# DETECTION

1. IOC (Indicator of Compromise)
    
    Evidence that indicates a system may be compromised, such as malicious IP addresses, file hashes, domains, or registry changes.
    
2. EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
    
    A security solution that monitors endpoint activities, detects suspicious behavior, and enables response actions such as isolation.
    
3. IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    
    A system that monitors network or host traffic and generates alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
    
4. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
    
    A system that detects and automatically blocks malicious traffic in real time.
    
5. Correlation Rule
    
    A logical rule in SIEM that links multiple related events to detect suspicious patterns or attack behavior.
    
6. Threat Intelligence
    
    Information about known threats, attackers, and indicators used to enhance detection and prevention capabilities.
    
7. False Positive
    
    An alert triggered by legitimate activity that is incorrectly classified as malicious.
    
8. False Negative
    
    A real security threat that goes undetected by monitoring tools.
    
9. MITRE ATT&CK
    
    A globally recognized framework that categorizes attacker tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

# RESPONSE

1. Incident
    
    A confirmed security event that compromises or threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems or data.
    
2. Incident Response
    
    A structured process used to detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents.
    
3. Containment
    
    Actions taken to limit the spread or impact of a security incident, such as isolating an infected endpoint.
    
4. Eradication
    
    The process of removing the root cause of the incident, including malware removal and patching vulnerabilities.
    
5. Playbook
    
    A documented, step-by-step guide outlining procedures for responding to specific types of security incidents.

# REPORTING

1. MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)
    
    The average time taken to identify a security incident after it occurs.
    
2. MTTR (Mean Time to Respond)
    
    The average time taken to contain and remediate a security incident.
    
3. SLA (Service Level Agreement)
    
    Defined response and resolution time commitments for handling alerts and incidents.
    
4. Incident Report
    
    A formal document detailing the timeline, impact, root cause, and resolution of a security incident.
